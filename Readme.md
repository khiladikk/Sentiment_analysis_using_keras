# Objective: 

To Perform sentiment analysis on the text reviews using simple neural network. We will use keras to build the simple neural network. Our goal is to analyse the text reviews whether its positive or negative and build confusion matrix to determine the accuracy.

## Introduction To Keras:
It's a deep learning framework which is built on the TensorFlow. It is developed by François Chollet. It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, Theano, and MXNet.

## Why Sentiment Analysis?

With the use of Sentiment Analysis, we want to predict for example a customers opinion and attitude about a product based on a review he wrote about it. Because of that, Sentiment Analysis is widely applied to things like reviews, surveys, documents and much more.
